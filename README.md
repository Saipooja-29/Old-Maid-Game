# Old-Maid-Game
Old maid game using the C++ language



Things Learned

●	Splitting a string and using each part as some information..
●	Creating a Card class and using it to create a deck of cards and also in dealing cards to players.
●	How to create an operator== overloading as necessary.
●	How to shuffle elements in a vector.
●	How to use vectors and map containers and receive
●	How to clear vector elements in a vector and remove specific elements in a vector and erase an element at a particular index/ index range.

Reason for using vectors and map containers in the Program
-	Vectors are used to set the deck as it is easy to retrieve the card details whenever it is necessary.
-	The complexity of using vectors to assign the card values or any elements is Linear.
-	The complexity for retrieving elements from the vector is Constant.
-	In this example we used a map to store the details of each player and cards dealt to them from the deck. This is because it is easy for us to have the count of the players in the form of keys and their cards as values in the form of vectors.
